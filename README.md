# Multimodal-Interaction

**Multimodal-Interaction** is a research-oriented Python project focusing on **multimodal interaction and representation learning**.  
The repository provides core components for modeling, aligning, and evaluating interactions between multiple data modalities.

The project is designed to support experiments in multimodal learning, where heterogeneous inputs (e.g., visual, textual, or other modalities) need to be jointly modeled and aligned in a shared representation space.

## Overview

This repository includes implementations of:

- Multimodal alignment mechanisms for bridging heterogeneous feature spaces  
- Neural network models designed for multimodal interaction  
- Loss functions tailored for multimodal learning objectives  
- Evaluation utilities for assessing multimodal representations and predictions  

The codebase is modular and extensible, making it suitable for research experiments, prototyping new multimodal interaction methods, or serving as a foundation for further development.

## Project Structure

- `Align.py` — Modules related to multimodal feature alignment  
- `models.py` — Definitions of multimodal interaction models  
- `losses.py` — Loss functions for multimodal training objectives  
- `evaluator.py` — Evaluation metrics and helper functions  

## Purpose

The goal of this project is to explore how different modalities can be effectively aligned and interacted within a unified learning framework, supporting tasks that require cross-modal understanding and integration.
